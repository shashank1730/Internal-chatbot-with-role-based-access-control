This was accompanied by a 10% increase in vendor-related expenses, impacting overall profit margins. While gross profit increased by 25%, reflecting higher operational efficiency, net income saw a more modest increase of 12%. This suggests that while revenue growth is strong, controlling vendor costs and maintaining healthy cash flows remain key to long-term profitability.\\n\\nExpense Breakdown by Category:\\n\\nThe primary drivers of expense in 2024 were:\\n\\nVendor Services - A total of $30M, representing a 18% increase from the previous year. The largest contributors were:\\n\\nMarketing-related expenses (Dinner, corporate events) – 40% of vendor services.\\n\\nTraining and education expenses – 30% of vendor services.\\n\\nSoftware subscriptions (cloud services, licensing) – 25% of vendor services.\"),\n",

While essential for brand positioning, these expenses need tighter management, potentially through vendor renegotiations or reduced event frequency.\\n\\nSoftware Subscriptions - A significant expense totaling $25M, up 22% from 2023. Given the heavy reliance on cloud-based tools and SaaS subscriptions, this area could benefit from more rigorous contract negotiation and potential consolidation of service providers.\\n\\nEmployee Benefits and HR Costs - With FinSolve Technologies's growth in headcount, HR expenses (benefits, recruitment, training) saw a 10% increase.

However, the delayed payment cycles from several key vendors resulted in accounts payable delays, which slightly impacted cash liquidity during the second half of 2024. Addressing these delays, particularly in vendor payments, will be crucial to ensuring smoother cash flow management.\\n\\nCash Flow from Investing Activities: Investments in research and development, new market entry, and acquisitions amounted to $15M, representing 20% of total cash flows.
